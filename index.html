        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a freshman at the University of California and currently I am working towards becoming a software engineer. My major currently is computer science and engineering. I love to work with many different types of electrical gadgets ranging from a small ipod to fixing and developing software. I have recently discovered how to start coding and creating my own websites. This has brought me many opportunities where I am able to help tons of friends and family by either making a site for their business or just updating all of their old computers to newer and better running computers which are also easier to use. One of the best developments I was able to update and totally change the coding in the software was making a site for my fathers business. This really improved the way clients made appointments and this also really helped due to the pandemic and clients having to socially distance.  Many customers left great reviews on the site which brought me another opportunity to make a site for my uncle's business. This site was pretty simple due all the experience from making my first site for my fathers business.<br><br>

        Some of my job experiences would include working as office clerk at Tulare Works, where I had to input client information from date of births of clients to client personal information. This allowed me to put my foot in the door where I was able to build connections throughout my community. This really helped me throughout my junior and senior years of high school due to being able to learn how to manage my time and start meeting many people to build relationships throughout my community. <br><br>

        During the pandemic and lockdown I was able to expand my knowledge on how to make dental softwares and how to maintain them. I was given this opportunity by working at a family friends dental clinic. This allowed me to learn more about the different types of softwares that are out there and how much you can do to the code and software to make it really nice and quality. I was able to help the clinic do the billing and also keep maintenance of all the technology in each lab station as well as being able to enter in new patients. All of these opportunities have allowed me to find my passion which is to build computers and to make different types of softwares to make all small businesses run so much better.
